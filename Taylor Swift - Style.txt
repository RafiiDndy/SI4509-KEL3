Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"

It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you) 

And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I Know exactly where it leads, but I Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
